This example features a simple webserver running on top of the IPv6
contiki stack. It differs from the generic webserver6 example in order
to store the web pages in avr flash memory.

The perl script /tools/makefsdata converts the default web content from
/platform/avr-raven/apps/raven-webserver/httpd-fs/*.* into the c source file
/platform/avr-raven/apps/raven-webserver/httpd-fsdata.c.
This file is not deleted in a $make clean so that a rebuild can be done without
perl in the toolchain (e.g. from a Windows cmd window). If any web file is
changed the dependencies will attempt to update httpd-fsdata.c. If perl
is not present, touching httpd-fsdata.c will give it a newer modification date
and allow the build to continue.
  
Two alternate web contents Huginn and Muninn are included in this directory.
Use e.g. $make WEBDIR=Huginn to generate a webserver6-huginn.elf file.
The ipv6 address suffix and server names are specified in the makefsdata.h file.

$make COFFEE_FILES=1 or 3 uses a static coffee file system in eeprom or program
flash memory.  Files can not be created, but existing files can be rewritten
using http POST via upload.html. When switching coffee types a $make clean
should be done to ensure all c source is on the same page (ahem).
-->This is under development and rewrites are not working yet.

Future plans are for $make COFFEE_FILES=2 or 4 for a full coffee file system.

A bare $make will use the avr-raven platform. Alternate compatible platforms can
be specified, e.g. $make TARGET=avr-atmega128rfa1. In that case the webserver
source and content located in that platform directory will be used.

webserver6.elf is always generated. It is copied to e.g. webserver6-avr-raven.elf
or webserver6-avr-atmega128rfa1.elf depending on the platform. If alternate
web content is specified the output file will be named accordingly, e.g.
$make WEBDIR=huginn
 (builds webserver6.elf and webserver6-huginn-avr-raven.elf)
$make WEBDIR=muninn TARGET=avr-atmega128rfa1
 (builds webserver6.elf and webserver6-muninn-avr-atmega128rfa1.elf)
 
$make clean affects only the specified target and webdir:

$make clean WEBDIR=huginn TARGET=avr-atmega128rfa1
 deletes the avr-atmega128rfa1 objects and webserver6-huginn-avr-atmega128rfa1.elf
 
$make clean
 deletes the avr-raven objects and webserver6-avr-raven.elf
